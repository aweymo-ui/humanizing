**Hello, my name is Andrew Weymouth** and I have worked with the University of Idaho Library as the [Digital Initiatives Librarian](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/people/aweymouth.html) in the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/) (CDIL) department since the fall of 2023. My work generally consists of creating and maintaining our digital collections, working with CDIL fellows, helping to rethink processes and introducing new digital scholarship tools to the department

## CollectionBuilder

The platform we host our collections on at the U of I is called [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/),  an “open source framework for creating digital collections and exhibit websites that are driven by metadata and modern static web technology”. This is also the platform we use to host our [Taylor Wilderness Research Station Archive collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/taylor-archive/) that I'll be focusing on today.
