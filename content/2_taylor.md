**Taylor is a secluded facility** in the heart of the [Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness](https://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/taylor-wilderness-research-station) in central Idaho, which University of Idaho has owned and managed since 1970. Surrounded by over two million acres of wilderness, the facility has been an invaluable resource for wildlife surveys, rangeland monitoring and plant identification. 

**A few years ago**, the CDIL was contacted by the people who run the station and were asked to digitize around 2000 documents that were vulnerable to deterioration. The documents were wide ranging, consisting of correspondences, memos and reports as well as hundreds of research papers that were the result of academic residencies at the station. Taylor management wanted to retain the physical documents, so the collection was never formally processed by our Special Collections department, presenting challenges that I will discuss in a moment.

**In a separate project,** also before my time at the university, CDIL Fellows Jack Kredell visited Taylor (which can only be hiked into or flown into on small backwoods planes) and interviewed professors, graduate students and superintendents at the institution. In Jack's words:

<blockquote class="quote">
"The oral history project explores both the social and ecological dimensions of Taylor Wilderness Research Station through recorded interviews with past and present researchers, teachers, station managers, and students" with "interviews focused on uncovering often-ignored social and experiential content behind scientific pursuit, offering a narrative index of social-ecological change within a wilderness environment."
</blockquote>

Under the guidance of Devin Becker, Associate Dean Research and Instruction for the library, the goal of this project was to create a collection combining these two resources which would not only give access to all of the scientific research that came out of the station but also provide interpretive material that would help visitors better understand the historic, human and geographic context of the institution.

## Metadata Standardization and Vetting

**Both of these projects had been dormant** for some time, due to some detailed metadata work that needed to be done to the collections. This work involved standardizing author, place names and subjects, as well as surveying the collection for duplicates, where the same document was accidentally digitized twice or even three times because the “accession” was never formally processed by an archivist. Special Collections would have caught these redundancies along with sensitive information I identified, such as applications that contained student social security numbers and home addresses of former student workers.

Documenting this process has enabled us to assess our procedures at CDIL for collections that are part of our [digital collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/) but not formally accessioned. These collections offer the opportunity to highlight unique or at-risk community archive materials, while allowing these smaller institutions to maintain permanent stewardship but we are still developing best practices for the challenges these types of initiatives pose regarding processing and digital preservation.
