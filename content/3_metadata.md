**Both of these projects had been dormant** for some time, due to some detailed metadata work that needed to be done to the collections. This work involved standardizing author, place names and subjects, as well as surveying the collection for duplicates, where the same document was accidentally digitized twice or even three times because the “accession” was never formally processed by an archivist, who would have caught these redundancies along with sensitive information I found, such as applications that contained student social security numbers and home addresses.
